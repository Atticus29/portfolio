Portfolio website

# Description
A website that serves as the entry point for potential employers to see examples of my work and resume details. Currently contains three inter-connected pages: index.html (the landing site, which is unfortunately the least mature), projects.html (which showcases some choice repos.), and about.html (which contains employment and education details that are typically found in a resume)
